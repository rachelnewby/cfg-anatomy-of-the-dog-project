# Anatomy of the Dog project

As part of the Code First Girls Introduction to Web Development course, we were tasked with creating our own website which used JavaScript. <br>
Working in a group of three, we decided to build a website which would mark out the anatomy of the dog, and as we progressed we scaled this up to include other animals too; cats and rabits, and we included a construction page, awaiting content for guinea pigs. <br>
This was the first time the three of us had used any JavaScript, we used to create our pop out boxes when a button is clicked on the page. The buttons were positioned using CSS. <br>
We also included a sign up form which incorporated elements of JavaScript, but this currently does not get posted to a database, and no functionality is added to the form. <br>
The website is fully responsive, and the images will change based on the user's device. 

## What's missing
This project was developed before learning about TDD or any testing suits, and for this reason there is no tests. There is also a lot of repetition; the code could be refactored. <br>
The file organisation does not follow the normal procdures either, as this project was built prior to understanding of this.
